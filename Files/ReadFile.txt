Input will be String , for example “UUXXDD” now the output must be in the format of two dimensional array Integer(0, -2)

Test case:sss
Input : “UUU”
Output : Integer(0,3) (x axis , y axis)
ss
12. Find the index and length of longest tuple(same character)

                 Example String str ="aaaaaabbbbbcc";
13. Rough reduce the string length. There will be a string with character patterns repeating, we need to replace the repeating pattern with * so that the string length will be reduced
14. Implement a function that takes in an array of non-negative         numbers and an integer.
Return the *LENGTH* of the shortest subarray whose sum is at least the integer, and -1 if no such sum exists. - Done
15. Program to find out the length of the shortest array whose sum is integer with a given array. Similar to #11
16. Display the count of consecutive character in the format of character and its count". -done
For Ex: aabbbbccb
Expected o/p: a2b4c2b1
      17. Find the square root of a number, N using below steps.
i.	Make an initial guess to get current estimate(eg: currentEstimate=N/4)
ii.	newEstimate = currentEstimate-((currentEstimate*currentEstimate-N) /2*currentEstimate)
iii.	if newEstimate is square root of N, return the value. Else repeat steps 2,3 with newEstimate as currentEstimate.

18.Given a 2D string array of Students with marks , find the maximum average of the student list.
i/p
{{“Sam”,”20”},
{“Tom”,”45”},
{“George”,”42”},
{“Tom”,”50”}} answer should be Tom and his average 47.5


19.	Write  a program to find the longest palindrome in given string.
i/p = ABCDCBAKMALYALAM123454321MALAYLAMJABAA
O/P =  MALYALAM123454321MALAYLAM

20.	Write a code to find the number of time given word appear in a file
21.	Write a code to compare two string irrespective of order and case in sessitive:
String = “Abcdre”
String2 = bdcare”
Both are equal string
22.	Unit testing of code
23.	 Difference between class and instance variable
24.	 Write a program to find the dot product of two array
25.	Write a program to find the length of cycle from startindex. Given integers where each element points to the  index of the next element how would you detect if there is a cycle in this array?  
  Eg.arr = [1,2,0] . startindex  is 0 arr[0] =1 ->arr[1]=2--arr[2] = 0--arr[0] = again 1 Cycle completed .So the length of the Cycle is 3

26.Find the shortest subarray which gives the maximum sum

27.Find Factorial with time complexity less than O(n)

28.Write a function to return an element from pascal triangle, given row and column number. 
e.g : pascal(0,0)= 1, pascal(2,1)=2, pascal(3,2)=3

def pascal(n,k):
    res = 1
    if (k > n - k) :
        k = n - k
    for i in range(0 , k) :
        res = res * (n - i)
        res = res // (i + 1)
    print res
n- row
k – column


Monitor selection process conduct by teacher by eliminating (n-1) number of students where n is total number of students,
Song will be played, and length of song will be K, teacher will circularly rotate and eliminate Kth index student, the process continues till only 1 student left
Teacher will start rotate from index 1.

For Ex if there are 4 (n) student and length of song is 2 (k) then 
teacher will start rotate from index 1, since length of song is 2(k), she stops and eliminated 2nd index student, then she will start from 3rd index and eliminate 4th index student (song length is(k=2))
next starting index will be 1st and 3nd index student got eliminated 
so, answer is 1(only remaining student) 


1)Find the shortest subarray which gives the maximum sum

2)Find Factorial with time complexity less than O(n)
